# Kaggle Digit Recognizer Project

## Objective
Classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Mission Statement
1. **Describe the Dataset:**
   - **Format:** CSV file
   - **Size:** 42000 samples for training and 28000 samples for testing
   - **Target:** Digits from 0 to 9

2. Create a Classification Strategy:
   - Preprocess the data
   - Explore the data
   - Implement several models:
     - Linear Model: Logistic Regression
     - Non-linear Model: Random Forest
     - Deep Learning Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
   - Evaluate the models
   - Compare the results

## Suggested Dataset
- Kaggle Digit Recognizer: [Digit Recognizer Data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data)


1. Modelization
   - Test several models:
     - At least one linear (e.g., Logistic Regression)
     - At least one non-linear (e.g., Random Forest)
     - One deep learning model (CNN)
   - Use a working pipeline for training and saving models

2. Performance:
   - Define a baseline
   - Conduct necessary comparisons
   - Ensure figures are readable with legends
   - Performance points weighted by model accuracy
